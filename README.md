# Thing or Other Thing

This is effectively a template for a game in which you see a spinning zoomed-in image of a thing, and you have to identify whether it belongs in category A or category B.

It was built as a celebration of the [Battle Geekz](http://battlegeekz.com/) podcast arriving to Poddle, my podcasting network at the time, and was the first ever game I built for the network.

The game data you see here is for "Policeman vs Pirates", which riffed on a topic the two presenters were discussing on their latest show. So in this game you have to answer as to whether a particular spinning image is of something police-related, or something pirate-related.

You can pretty much swap out `data.js` and the `assets` folder for something else... just change all the Battle Geekz and Poddle related stuff :)
